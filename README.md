## 🧠 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Enterprise Hybrid Graph-RAG
Hybrid retrieval architecture combining:
- Graph traversal (multi-hop reasoning)
- Vector similarity search
- Evaluation metrics + latency instrumentation
- Claude 3 (Amazon Bedrock) integration

Focus: Accuracy, retrieval quality, production design

### 🔹 AWS Iceberg Lakehouse (Terraform)
- ACID lakehouse on S3
- Apache Iceberg tables
- Glue + Athena
- Fully provisioned via Terraform

Focus: Reproducible enterprise infrastructure
